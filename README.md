# CEF Sharp Store Cookies

This repo contains a simple application utilizing **CEF SHARP**. 
The main purpose of this app is to make it so when you log into a website and then close and re-open the app, you would still be logged in.
In other words persisting cookies.

When you run the app for the first time, a JSON config file will be created.
There you can configure the app's starting URL, WinForm preferences and wether to enable or disable persisting cookies.

App was done by me for a client.
If you have questions, feel free to contact me.
